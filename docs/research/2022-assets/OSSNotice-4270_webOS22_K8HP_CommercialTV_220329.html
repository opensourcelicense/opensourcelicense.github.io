Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following: <br><br>     a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies; <br>     b) to prepare derivative works (&quot;Derivative Works&quot;) based upon the Original Work; <br>     c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public; <br>     d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and <br>     e) to display the Original Work publicly.   <br><br>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.  <br><br>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term &quot;Source Code&quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work.  Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.  Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.    <br><br>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.  Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein.  No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2.  No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work.  Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.  <br><br>5) This section intentionally omitted.  <br><br>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution Notice.&quot;  You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.  <br><br>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights.  Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.  This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License.  No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.  <br><br>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.  This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.  <br><br>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute  copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License.  Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.  Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.    <br><br>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, for patent infringement (i) against Licensor with respect to a patent applicable to software or (ii) against any entity with respect to a patent applicable to the Original Work (but excluding combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware).    <br><br>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. &curren; 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty.  This section shall survive the termination of this License.  <br><br>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action.  This section shall survive the termination of this License.  <br><br>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.    <br><br>14) Definition of &quot;You&quot; in This License. &quot;You&quot; throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.  For legal entities, &quot;You&quot; includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.  For purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.   <br><br>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.    <br><br>This license is Copyright (C) 2003 Lawrence E.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:<br><br>     2.1 Unmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:<br><br>          (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and<br><br>          (b)  You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.<br><br>     2.2 Modified Code.  You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>          (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code; <br><br>          (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and<br><br>          (c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available.  Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).<br><br>     2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.  <br><br>     2.4 Third Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.<br><br>3. Your Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.  <br><br>4. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof. <br><br>5. Limitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein.  Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.  <br><br>6. Additional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein (&quot;Additional Terms&quot;) to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms. <br><br>7. Versions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.  <br><br>8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.  The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk.  THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS &quot;APPLE&quot; FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.<br><br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).<br><br>10. Trademarks.  This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names  &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Mac&quot;, &quot;Mac OS&quot;, &quot;QuickTime&quot;, &quot;QuickTime Streaming Server&quot; or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively &quot;Apple Marks&quot;) or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor.  You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.  <br><br>11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor.  Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple (&quot;Apple Modifications&quot;), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License.  Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.  <br><br>12. Termination.  <br><br>     12.1 Termination.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:<br>     <br>          (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach;<br><br>          (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or<br><br>          (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.<br><br>     12.2 Effect of Termination.  Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13.  No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.<br><br>13.  Miscellaneous.<br><br>     13.1 Government End Users.   The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as defined in FAR 2.101.  Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br><br>     13.2 Relationship of Parties.  This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.<br><br>     13.3 Independent Development.   Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may develop, produce, market or distribute.<br><br>     13.4 Waiver; Construction.  Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.  Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.<br><br>     13.5 Severability.  (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect.  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.<br><br>     13.6 Dispute Resolution.  Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br><br>     13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law. <br><br>     Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies:  The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English.  Les parties ont exig&eacute; que le pr&eacute;sent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient r&eacute;dig&eacute;s en anglais.<br><br>EXHIBIT A. <br><br>&quot;Portions Copyright (c) 1999-2007 Apple Inc.

C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.<br><br>8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.

THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.<br><br>BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.<br><br>1. Definitions<br><br>a. &quot;Adaptation&quot; means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.<br><br>b. &quot;Collection&quot; means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.<br><br>c. &quot;Distribute&quot; means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.<br><br>d. &quot;Licensor&quot; means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.<br><br>e. &quot;Original Author&quot; means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.<br><br>f. &quot;Work&quot; means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.<br><br>g. &quot;You&quot; means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.<br><br>h. &quot;Publicly Perform&quot; means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.<br><br>i. &quot;Reproduce&quot; means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.<br><br>2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.<br><br>3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:<br><br>a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;<br><br>b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;<br><br>c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,<br><br>d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.<br><br>e. For the avoidance of doubt:<br><br>i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;<br><br>ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,<br><br>iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.<br><br>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.<br><br>4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:<br><br>a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.<br><br>b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.<br><br>c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.<br><br>5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer<br><br>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>7. Termination<br><br>a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.<br><br>b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.<br><br>8. Miscellaneous<br><br>a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br><br>b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.<br><br>c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.<br><br>e. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.<br><br>f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.<br><br>Creative Commons Notice<br><br>Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.<br><br>Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark &quot;Creative Commons&quot; or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this License.<br><br>Creative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.<br>

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.<br><br>Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.<br><br>Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor&rsquo;s permission is not necessary for any reason&ndash;for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright&ndash;then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.<br><br>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License<br><br>By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.<br><br>Section 1 &ndash; Definitions.<br><br>a.	Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.<br><br>b.	Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br><br>c.	Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.<br><br>d.	Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.<br><br>e.	Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.<br><br>f.	Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.<br><br>g.	Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.<br><br>h.	Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.<br><br>i.	Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.<br><br>j.	Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.<br><br>k.	You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.<br><br>Section 2 &ndash; Scope.<br><br>a.	License grant.<br><br>1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:<br><br>A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and<br><br>B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.<br><br>2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.<br><br>3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).<br><br>4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.<br><br>5. Downstream recipients.<br><br>A. Offer from the Licensor &ndash; Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.<br><br>B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.<br><br>6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).<br><br>b. Other rights.<br><br>1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.<br><br>2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.<br><br>3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.<br><br>Section 3 &ndash; License Conditions.<br><br>Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.<br><br>a.	Attribution.<br><br>1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:<br><br>A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:<br><br>i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);<br><br>ii. a copyright notice;<br><br>iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;<br><br>iv.	a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;<br><br>v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;<br><br>B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and<br><br>C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.<br><br>2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.<br><br>3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.<br><br>4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.<br><br>Section 4 &ndash; Sui Generis Database Rights.<br><br>Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:<br><br>a.	for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;<br><br>b.	if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and<br><br>c.	You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. <br>For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.<br><br>Section 5 &ndash; Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.<br><br>a.	Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.<br><br>b.	To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.<br><br>c.	The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.<br><br>Section 6 &ndash; Term and Termination.<br><br>a.	This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.<br><br>b.	Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:<br><br>1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or<br><br>2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.<br><br>c.	For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.<br><br>d.	For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.<br><br>e.	Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.<br><br>Section 7 &ndash; Other Terms and Conditions.<br><br>a.

					<br>Eclipse Public License - v 1.0<br><br>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>1. DEFINITIONS<br><br>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:<br>     a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and<br>     b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br>          i) changes to the Program, and<br>          ii) additions to the Program;<br><br>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br><br>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br><br>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br><br>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.<br><br>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br><br>     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br> <br>     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br><br>     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br><br>     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>3. REQUIREMENTS<br>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:<br><br>     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br> <br>     b) its license agreement:<br>          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br>          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br>          iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.<br><br>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br><br>     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br><br>     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br><br>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br><br>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br><br>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br><br>5. NO WARRANTY<br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br><br>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>7. GENERAL<br><br>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br><br>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br>

					<br>The FreeType Project LICENSE <br><br>2006-Jan-27<br><br>Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg <br><br>Introduction <br><br>The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.<br><br>This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.<br><br>This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:<br><br>     o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)<br><br>     o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)<br><br>     o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')<br><br>We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. <br><br>Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:<br><br>     &quot;&quot;&quot; Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. &quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br>Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. <br><br>Legal Terms <br><br>0. Definitions <br><br>Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.<br><br>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.<br><br>This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive.

The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.<br><br>     o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.

					<br>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE <br>Version 1, February 1989<br>Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>Preamble<br><br>The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.<br><br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.<br><br>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br><br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br><br>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy.<br><br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:<br><br>a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and<br><br>b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option).<br><br>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this General Public License.<br><br>d) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of these terms.<br><br>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>a) accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br><br>b) accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,<br><br>c) accompany it with the information you received as to where the corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form alone.)<br><br>Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating system.<br><br>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>5. By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions.<br><br>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br><br>7. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>8. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>NO WARRANTY<br><br>9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

					<br>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>Version 2, June 1991<br><br>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  <br>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>Preamble<br><br>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.<br><br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br><br>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.<br><br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.<br><br>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br><br>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>NO WARRANTY<br><br>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors' reputations.<br>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>parties under the terms of this License.<br>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is<br>allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>NO WARRANTY<br>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License** as published by<br>the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>(at your option) any later version.<br>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the<br>GNU General Public License for more details.<br>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br>Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may<br>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br>necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br>Ty Coon, President of Vice<br>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br>Public License instead of this License.<br>

Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it.

So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.<br><br>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;. This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.<br><br>We are required to state that <br>     &quot;The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated.

					<br>Version 1.0<br>This Jabber Open Source License (the &quot;License&quot;) applies to Jabber Server and related software products as well as any updates or maintenance releases of that software (&quot;Jabber Products&quot;) that are distributed by Jabber.Com, Inc. (&quot;Licensor&quot;). Any Jabber Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law. This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product.<br>Preamble<br>This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and scope of this License. However, this Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the terms of the License and not this Preamble.<br>This License complies with the Open Source Definition and has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked as &quot;OSI Certified Open Source Software.&quot;<br>This License provides that:<br>1.      You may use, sell or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs from several different sources. No royalty or other fee is required.<br>2.      Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available for your use. (The terms &quot;Licensed Product,&quot; &quot;Modifications,&quot; &quot;Contributors&quot; and &quot;Source Code&quot; are defined in the License.)<br>3.      You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term &quot;Derivative Works&quot; is defined in the License.)<br>4.      By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this License. In particular, you must make the Source Code of your Modifications available to others.<br>5.      You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't work properly or causes you any injury or damages.<br>6.      If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or liability obligations to your customers. You cannot charge for the Source Code.<br>7.      If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically terminate.<br>You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.<br>Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License, however, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.<br>New versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product.<br>This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.<br>License Terms<br>1.      Grant of License From Licensor. Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:<br>a.       Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.<br>b.       Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.<br>2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. &quot;Modifications&quot; means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of (i) a file containing Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that contains any part of Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, the term &quot;Licensed Product&quot; shall include all previous Modifications that you receive from any Contributor. By application of the provisions in Section 4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a &quot;Contributor&quot;) hereby grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:<br>a.  Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.<br>Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.3.      Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product with other software or hardware. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.<br>4.      Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.<br>a.       Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 4(e).<br>b.       Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data (an &quot;Electronic Distribution Mechanism&quot;). The Source Code for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or Modifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br>c.       Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions, changes or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the dates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and include the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you distribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed Product. You may not modify or delete any preexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product.<br>d.       Intellectual Property Matters.<br>                                   i.            Third Party Claims. If you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; that describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that new knowledge has been obtained.<br>                               ii.            Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface (&quot;API&quot;) and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br>                              iii.            Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(d)(i) above, you believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br>e.       Required Notices. You must duplicate this License in any documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to Licensed Product. You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A (the &quot;Notice&quot;) in each file of the Source Code of any copy you distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer.<br>f.        Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related documentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all existing copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any terms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such Contributor as a result of any terms you offer.<br>g.       Distribution of Derivative Works. You may create Derivative Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.<br>5.      Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer programming to be able to understand it.<br>6.      Application of This License. This License applies to code to which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, which is incorporated herein by this reference.<br>7.      Versions of This License.<br>a.       New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.<br>b.       Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version of the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.<br>c.       Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that differ from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.<br>8.      Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD LICENSED PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br>9.      Termination.<br>a.       Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.<br>b.       Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from Respondent (the &quot;Notice Period&quot;) unless within that Notice Period you either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.<br>c.       Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<br>d.       No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br>10.  Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>11.  Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br>12.  U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Product is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.<br>13.  Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. You expressly agree that any litigation relating to this license shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California or the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, California (as appropriate), with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You and Licensor expressly waive any rights to a jury trial in any litigation concerning Licensed Product or this License. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br>14.  Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7. For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>15.

					<br>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br><br>Version 2.1, February 1999<br><br>Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br><br>Preamble<br><br>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br><br>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br><br>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br><br>We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br><br>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br><br>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br><br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br><br>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br><br>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br><br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br> <br>     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br><br>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br><br>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br><br>     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br>     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br><br>     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br><br>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br><br>     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br><br>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>NO WARRANTY<br><br>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br><br>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br><br>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>     Copyright (C) year  name of author<br><br>     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br><br>Preamble<br><br>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br><br>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br><br>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br><br>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br><br>We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br><br>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br><br>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br><br>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br><br>A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br><br>The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.

(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br><br>&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br><br>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br> <br>     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br><br>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br><br>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br><br>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br>However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br>When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br><br>     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br>     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br><br>     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br><br>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br><br>     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br><br>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br><br>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br><br>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>NO WARRANTY<br><br>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br><br>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br><br>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>     one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.<br>     Copyright (C) year  name of author<br><br>     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br><br>     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary.

Distribution Obligations.<br><br>     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br><br>     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br><br>     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br>     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br><br>          (a) Third Party Claims<br>          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>          (b) Contributor APIs<br>          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br><br>          (c) Representations.<br>          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br><br>     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br><br>     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Application of this License.<br>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br>     6.1. New Versions<br>     Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions<br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br><br>     6.3. Derivative Works<br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br><br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<br>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br>8. Termination<br><br>     8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br><br>     8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:<br><br>          a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>          b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br><br>     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<br><br>     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>10. U.S. government end users<br>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br><br>11. Miscellaneous<br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br><br>12. Responsibility for claims<br>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br>13. Multiple-licensed code<br>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.<br><br>&quot;The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Grants<br>     Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:<br><br>          (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and<br><br>          (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br><br>     2.2. Effective Date<br>     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.<br><br>     2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br>     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:<br><br>          (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or<br><br>          (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or<br><br>          (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.<br><br>     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br><br>     2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br>     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br><br>     2.5. Representation<br>     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br><br>     2.6. Fair Use<br>     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.<br><br>     2.7. Conditions<br>     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.<br><br>3. Responsibilities<br><br>     3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br>     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.<br><br>     3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br>     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br><br>          (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br><br>          (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br><br>     3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br>     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).<br><br>     3.4. Notices<br>     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br> <br>     3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br>     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation <br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Termination <br><br>     5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.<br><br>     5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br><br>     5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>6. Disclaimer of Warranty <br>Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. <br><br>7. Limitation of Liability <br>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You. <br><br>8. Litigation <br>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.<br><br>9. Miscellaneous <br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br><br>10. Versions of the License <br><br>     10.1. New Versions<br>     Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br>     10.2. Effect of New Versions<br>     You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.<br><br>     10.3. Modified Versions<br>     If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).<br><br>     10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses<br>     If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.<br><br>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice <br><br>     This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.<br><br>If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.<br><br>You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.<br><br>Exhibit B - &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot; Notice <br><br>     This Source Code Form is &quot;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses&quot;, as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.<br>

Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br><br>     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br><br>5. Application of this License.<br>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br>     6.1. New Versions<br>     Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions<br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br><br>     6.3. Derivative Works<br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br><br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY<br>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br>8. Termination<br><br>     8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br><br>     8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that:<br><br>          a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.<br>          b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br><br>     8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<br><br>     8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY<br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>10. U.S. government end users<br>The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br><br>11. Miscellaneous<br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br><br>12. Responsibility for claims<br>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br>13. Multiple-licensed code<br>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>Exhibit A - Mozilla Public License.<br><br>&quot;The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

Any Additional Notice Provisions which actually appears in the Original Code must also be retained or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code.<br><br>     3.2 Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any of SGI&rsquo;s rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient&rsquo;s role as licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient&rsquo;s choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI.

Any sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.<br><br>5. No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this License are reserved. <br><br>6. Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws, regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.<br><br>7. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.<br><br>8. Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br><br>9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot; ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.<br><br>11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.<br><br>12.

					<br>1. INTRODUCTION<br>The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android (&quot;FDK AAC Codec&quot;) is software that implements the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding (&quot;AAC&quot;) encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio. This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.<br><br>AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part of the MPEG specifications.<br><br>Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer) may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.<br><br>Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality, are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.<br><br>2. COPYRIGHT LICENSE<br>Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted without payment of copyright license fees provided that you satisfy the following conditions: <br><br>You must retain the complete text of this software license in redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in source code form.<br><br>You must retain the complete text of this software license in the documentation and/or other materials provided with redistributions of the FDK AAC Codec or your modifications thereto in binary form. You must make available free of charge copies of the complete source code of the FDK AAC Codec and your modifications thereto to recipients of copies in binary form.<br><br>The name of Fraunhofer may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this library without prior written permission.<br><br>You may not charge copyright license fees for anyone to use, copy or distribute the FDK AAC Codec software or your modifications thereto.<br><br>Your modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec must carry prominent notices stating that you changed the software and the date of any change. For modified versions of the FDK AAC Codec, the term &quot;Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android&quot; must be replaced by the term &quot;Third-Party Modified Version of the Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android.&quot;<br><br>3. NO PATENT LICENSE<br>NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without limitation the patents of Fraunhofer, ARE GRANTED BY THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE. Fraunhofer provides no warranty of patent non-infringement with respect to this software.<br><br>You may use this FDK AAC Codec software or modifications thereto only for purposes that are authorized by appropriate patent licenses.<br><br>4. DISCLAIMER<br>This FDK AAC Codec software is provided by Fraunhofer on behalf of the copyright holders and contributors &quot;AS IS&quot; and WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
